# Assessment Instructions

### If you're here that means: ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ You've hit MVP!!! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
* There are just 3 assessments and 2 interview questions left before you are officially a NSS graduate. These assessments will cover: 
  * Creating an ERD
  * SQL
  * Django

* This will also assess your ability to solve problems and ask for help. Use your resources! This includes instructors, google, and past projects. This does not include teammates.  You **do not** need to complete these from memory. Your future career will still include googling and asking for help. We want to know how well you have learned to use what you already have.

* The assessments can be done in any order. You'll go over your ERD during the interview. The django and sql assessments include tests so you'll know if you got the code right.
* Let an instructor know once your django repo is created so the issues can be added to your repo
